/// for futures.  You can deposit units into a counter,
/// or take them away.  Taking units from the counter may wait
/// if not enough units are available.
///
/// To support exceptional conditions, a \ref broken() method
/// is provided, which causes all current waiters to stop waiting,
/// with an exceptional future returned.  This allows causing all
/// fibers that are blocked on a semaphore to continue.  This is
/// similar to POSIX's `pthread_cancel()`, with \ref wait() acting
/// as a cancellation point.
