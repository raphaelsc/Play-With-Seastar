/// \brief Like \ref future except the result can be waited for by many fibers.
///
/// Represents a value which may not yet be ready. A fiber can wait for the value using
/// the \ref future obtained by calling \ref get_future() or casting to \ref future type.
/// Multiple fibers are allowed to obtain a \ref future for the result using the same
/// instance of \ref shared_future.
///
/// All futures obtained from shared_future should end up in the same state. However,
/// if the value's copy constructor throws, some of the futures may end up in a failed state
/// with an exception thrown from the copy constructor and end up with a state
/// different than other futures.
///
/// The scope of shared_future instance doesn't have to include scopes of the futures
/// obtained from that instance. In that sense the returned futures are independent.
///
/// shared_future can be copied at any time and all copies will resolve with the same value.
///
/// shared_future can be in a disengaged state when it's default-constructed or moved-from.
/// When it's in such a state we say it's invalid and obtaining futures must not be attempted.
///
/// The types in the parameter pack T must all be copy-constructible.
